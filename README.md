# Hackathon AI Traffic Volume Prediction ðŸš¦

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting traffic volume. The dataset includes features such as weather conditions, timestamps, holidays, and more, which are used to build an accurate traffic forecasting model. The project demonstrates advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, univariate and bivariate analysis, and the use of multiple machine learning algorithms to optimize predictions.
